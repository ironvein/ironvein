# IronVein

An empire-building strategy and management game inspired by Dwarf Fortress and OpenTTD.

## Information

IronVein is a community project launched in the hope of creating a fun, involved and complex real-time strategy and management empire-building game. Imagine taking Dwarf Fortress, OpenTTD, Minecraft and Age of Empires and mixing them together inside a big vat of digital gloop. Bake the result and then polish it. That's what IronVein aims to be. Despite this, IronVein attempts to explore concepts, mechanics and ideas not previously explored by such games. In that sense, IronVein is not a clone, and does not aim to be a clone.

## Inspiration

As stated above in the Information section, IronVein draws on many different games as inspiration.

In April 2016, I took part in Ludum Dare. My game idea was simple: clone Dwarf Fortress. Although it came nowhere close to the amazing complexity that makes Dwarf Fortress such a beautiful and interesting game, I was pleasantly surprised by the results, as were other people who tried out the game during testing. This inspired me to rewrite the project into IronVein.
